Hi, I’m @unabashedgeek
I’m interested in preventing my mind from atrophying
I’m currently learning javascript using Wes Bos's course
I wrote my first program in 1966 and my most recent one last week in 2022. Howeve, these days I'm probably more inerested in photography
videography and making things.
